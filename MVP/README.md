>***Overview**\
MVP (Model-View-Presenter) is an architectural pattern in Android applications that separates the application logic\
from the user interface. It is a derivative of the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern but with the availability of\
the Presenter layer. MVP separates the application into three distinct layers, each having its responsibilities.
